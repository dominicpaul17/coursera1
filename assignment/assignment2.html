                   <p>
                    Asian parents often give their children almonds on exam days. This is with good reason: Compounds found in almonds help regulate the production of an important hormone in the brain called dopamine. Dopamine is a key player in proper brain development, sharpens the memory, and boosts mood. Almonds are one of the best nuts for health as well. Eat these soaked nuts in the early part of your day.
